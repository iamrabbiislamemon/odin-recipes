    <h1>Chingri Malaikari</h1>
    <h2>Chingri Bhuna | Bangladeshi Dry Shrimp Curry</h2>
    <p><b>This Bangladeshi Chingri Bhuna is luscious, spicy, and absolutely drool worthy!</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>Perfect for dinner parties or just a special meal at home. This curry pairs well with some plain steamed white rice, or pulao.</p>
    <br>

    <p><b>This dish is usually made with very large tiger prawns but regular colossal shrimp works too!</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>You can also use this same recipe to make any other kind of seafood you want, like crabs, lobster, fish steaks/fillets. Or even any smaller sized shrimps (just fry less at the beginning to keep them from overcooking)</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>If you want your curry to be more orange/yellow instead of brown:</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>Don’t brown the onions too much as they add color. And go easy on the cumin and gorom mosholla/garam masala.</p>

    <p><b>I usually leave the shells on for my shrimp to make things easier (they also add more flavor),</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>But you can ofcourse choose to peel them. I would recommend just taking off the middle shell and leaving the tails and head intact for the look and extra flavor.</p>

        <li>Heat your pan on high heat, pour in your oil and let it heat up. Then toss in your shrimp and fry for just a minute until nice and golden/orange, flipping halfway through. Do not overcook, and fry in 2 batches if needed so you don’t overcrowd the pan and can get a nice fry.</li>
