    <h1><b>Dal Puri | Deep Fried Dough with a Lentil Filling</b></h1>
    <p><b>Once of my favorite snacks from back home!</b></p>
    <p>These golden fluffy fried dough disks filled with the most simple and delicious dal filling can be found at fried food stalls all over Dhaka. I mostly had them at home, so today I’ll be showing you how to recreate the perfect fluffy puris at home!</p>

    <p><b>For the best dough:</b></p>
    <p>You want to make sure to mix the flour, salt, and oil together well first before adding the water. This will make the dough flakier.</p>
    <p>You can rest the dough just till your dal is cooled and ready to use but I would highly recommend letting it rest on the counter for at least 2-3 hours or overnight in the fridge for best results. This will make the dough light and soft and the puris will fluff up beautifully.</p>
    <p>When resting your dough in the refrigerator, take it out an hour or two before you are ready to roll them out and let it come up to room temperature before using.</p>

    <p><b>Some more tips:</b></p>
    <p>Make the dal a day ahead also and it will taste even better with the resting time. You don’t need to dry the dal out completely when cooking, just as long as there’s no extra liquid at the bottom. The dal will dry out more as it cools, especially if you spread it out on a plate to cool.

        <br><br>When you stretch the dough balls out to fill them, leave the centers of the dough thicker than the edges as you will be pulling the edges together to close the ball and you want both sides to be around the same thickness once the ball is formed. This way you won’t rip a hole in your puri while rolling.

        <br><br>When rolling out the puris, only do a few at a time (however many you can fry at once in your pan) so that they don’t dry out before frying. You can also cover your puris with clingfilm or a plate while you’re waiting to fry.</p>
