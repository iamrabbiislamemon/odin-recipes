    <p>Shorshe Ilish is a classic Bangladeshi recipe made with mustard paste, green chillies and mustard oil. The dish that makes a Bengali, I personally think. Ilish, or anglicized as Hilsa is a fish that holds a very special place in every Bengali’s heart. There is no other fish in the world that even comes close to it’s taste, flavor or aroma. </p>
    <br>
    <p>In my parents home, Ilish is a staple that is cooked almost every other week. The way an average American may think of a good rib-eye steak or a fillet mignon, that’s how us Bengalis feel about Ilish. Yes, a good quality Ilish might cost a pretty penny, but it is worth every cent.  It’s always a celebration when Ilish is being cooked at home. And you know when I come to think of it, no Bengali celebration is complete without an Ilish based dish. They say, there are more than 100 ways Bengalis can cook Ilish and I fully concur with that saying.</p>

    <p><b>About Ilish</b></p>
    <p>Ilish, or Hilsa Fish is the national fish of Bangladesh and the state fish of West Bengal, India. This fish contributes to about 12% of the total fish production and about 1.15% of GDP in Bangladesh. Also known as Hilsa Herring or Hilsa Shad, this is a species of fish related to the herring. It's rich in omega 3 fatty acids which gives the fish its' marbled fat content and softness. </p>
    <br>
    <p>To my knowledge, you can only find this fish in Bangladeshi grocery stores if you live outside of Bangladesh or India. But that should not stop you from trying this wonderful recipe. As I’ve said before, there is no other fish in the world that has the same taste, flavor or aroma as Ilish. It’s kind of like how there is no other fish that tastes like Salmon.  But considering Ilish is so full of omega 3,  this recipe can work with other types of fish also  high in Omega 3 or from the herring family. Other types of fish like shad, herring, salmon, mackerel, sardine and trout are great alternatives.</p>

    <p><b>Recipe — Shorshe Ilish</b></p>
    <p><b>Hilsa Fish in a Mustard Gravy</b></p>
    <p><b>Preparing the Mustard Paste</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>White Mustard - 2 tbsp</li>
        <li>Black Mustard - 1 tbsp</li>
        <li>Black Mustard - 1 tbsp</li>
        <li>Green Chilies - 3</li>
        <li>Green Chilies - 3</li>
        <li>Sugar - just a pinch</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Soak all the ingredients in warm water for 30 minutes. Place them in a blender and grind till a smooth paste is formed. The finished paste should be a creamy yellow color with black and green flecks. Try to make this paste right before cooking and not earlier. The sharpness and bitterness of mustard increases while sitting so don’t make this ahead of time or store for more than a day or two. If you have extra mustard paste, the best way to store it is by freezing it right away.</p>
    <p><b>Preparing the Fish</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ilish (Hilsa) - 4-6 pieces - bone in steaks cut into 2-3 inches wide</li>
        <li>Turmeric - 1 tsp</li>
        <li>Salt - 1 tsp</li>
        <li>Mustard Oil - 1-2 tsp</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ilish is a very delicate fish so be gentle while cleaning and preparing it. Descale, wash and pat dry the fish. Mix the turmeric and salt in mustard oil. Rub the fish on both sides with the oil mix and set it aside for 30 minutes.</p>

    <p><b>Bringing it Together</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Oil - 2-3 tbsp, mustard oil or vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Nigella Seeds - 1 tsp</li>
        <li>Onion - ½ cup, sliced (optional)</li>
        <li>Turmeric - ½ tsp</li>
        <li>Red Chilli Powder - 1 tsp</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Steps</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a wide skillet over medium heat. Add the nigella seeds and cook for 30 seconds. Add the onions and stir frequently until translucent. Add the spices - turmeric and red chili powder and mix until the water has evaporated and the oil shimmers through the spice mixture. Make sure not to let the spices burn. You may add a splash of water if needed.</li>
        <p>Note: I prefer onion in my Shorshe Ilish but traditionally aromatics like onion, ginger and garlic are not added. If the Ilish you bought has been frozen for a long time, you may add a teaspoon of ginger paste. Traditionally, ginger is a big no, especially when it comes to fresh fish. But outside of Bangladesh and India, Ilish can only be found frozen. Check the expiry date and try to get the freshest/newest batch of frozen fish whenever buying Ilish. Only add ginger if the fish has been frozen for too long and emanates a slight oily smell. </p>
        <li>Add the marinated fish pieces in a single layer to the skillet and gently sear on each side, about 1-2 minutes on each side. We are not making a crispy Ilish Bhaja here, just giving it a nice golden color before the mustard paste is added.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Coconut Milk - ¼ cup (optional)</li>
            <li>Green Chilies - 3-5</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Pour in the mustard paste and coat the fish pieces on both sides. If you find the mustard paste is slightly bitter and pungent for your liking, add a bit of coconut milk. The best way to balance out bitterness is with fat and sugar. Coconut milk is naturally sweet and high in fat, but they are considered healthy fat just an FYI. Once the fish pieces are well-coated in mustard paste (and coconut milk), add some slit green chilies and cover the lid. Turn the heat down to medium-low and simmer the fish in the mustard sauce, for 15 to 20 minutes. Check in between to make sure the bottom isn’t catching or the fish pieces aren’t burning. If the gravy is seems to dry up quickly, add a splash of water or coconut milk. Once the gravy has reached your desired consistency, turn off the heat. Serve immediately. Enjoy it with steamed rice or Panta Bhat.</li>
